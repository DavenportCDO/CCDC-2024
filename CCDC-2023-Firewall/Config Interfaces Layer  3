Configure Layer 3 Interfaces

 if a tunnel is used for routing or if tunnel monitoring is turned on,
 the tunnel needs an IP address. Before performing the following task, 
 define one or more Virtual Routers.
 
 You would typically use the following procedure
 to configure an external interface 
 that connects to the internet 
 and an interface for your internal network. 
 
 
 
 Select an interface and configure it with a security zone.
 
Select NetworkInterfaces and either Ethernet, VLAN, loopback, or Tunnel,
 depending on what type of interface you want.
 
Select the interface to configure.

Select the Interface Type—Layer3.

On the Config tab, for Virtual Router, 
select the virtual router you are configuring,
 such as default.

For Virtual System, select the virtual
 system you are configuring if on a multi-virtual
 system firewall.

For Security Zone,
 select the zone to 
 which the interface belongs
 or create a New Zone.

Click OK.

Configure the interface 
with an IPv4 address.

You can assign an IPv4 address
 to a Layer 3 interface in one of three ways:

Static-

DHCP Client
—The firewall interface acts as a DHCP client 
and receives a dynamically assigned IP address. 
The firewall also provides the capability to propagate 
settings received by the DHCP client interface into a DHCP 
server operating on the firewall. This is most commonly 
used to propagate DNS server settings from an Internet service 
provider to client machines operating on the network protected
 by the firewall.
 
PPPoE
—Configure the interface as a 
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) 
termination point to support connectivity in a 
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) environment where 
there is a DSL modem but no other PPPoE device to 
terminate the connection.

SETUP:
>Select Network>Interfaces> and either Ethernet,
 VLAN, loopback, or Tunnel, 
 depending on what type of interface you want.

>Select the interface to configure.

>To configure the interface with a 
static IPv4 address, on the IPv4 tab, 
set Type to Static.

>Add a Name and optional 
Description for the address.

>For Type, select one of the following:

>IP Netmask—Enter the IP address and 
network mask to assign to the interface,
 for example, 208.80.56.100/24.

>If you’re using a /31 subnet mask for the Layer 3 
interface address, the interface must be configured with 
the .1/31 address in order for utilities such as ping 
to work properly.

>If you’re configuring a loopback interface 
with an IPv4 address, it must have a /32 subnet mask; 
for example, 192.168.2.1/32.

>IP Range—Enter an IP address range, 
such as 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.4.

>FQDN—Enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name.

>Select Tags to apply to the address.

>Click OK.

>Configure an interface with Point-to-Point Protocol 
over Ethernet (PPPoE). See Layer 3 Interfaces.

-PPPoE is not supported in HA active/active mode.-

>Select NetworkInterfaces and 
either Ethernet, VLAN, loopback, or Tunnel.

>Select the interface to configure.

>On the IPv4 tab, set Type to PPPoE.

>On the General tab, select Enable 
to activate the interface for
 PPPoE termination.

>Enter the Username for 
the point-to-point connection.

>Enter the Password for the
 username and Confirm Password.

>Click OK.

>Configure an Interface as a 
DHCP Client so that it receives 
a dynamically-assigned IPv4 address.
