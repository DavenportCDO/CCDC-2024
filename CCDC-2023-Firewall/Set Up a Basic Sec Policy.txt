To verify that you have set up your basic policies effectively, 
 test whether your Security policy rules are being evaluated and determine
 which Security policy rule applies to a traffic flow.
 
For example, to verify the policy rule that will be applied for 
a client in the user zone with the IP address 10.35.14.150 
when it sends a DNS query to the DNS server in the data center:

Select DeviceTroubleshooting a
nd select Security Policy Match (Select Test).

Enter the Source and Destination IP addresses.

Enter the Protocol.

Select dns (Application)

Execute the Security policy match test.
